# Garvis Project
This project is an artificial intelligence secretary who helps Gachon Univ. students.


## The reason we started the project

> We gained convenience through many applications while we were in college. However, there were times when we felt bothered by separate information and functions.
We thought it would be more meaningful to do a project to help Gachon University students before graduation.
>
> So we integrated the functions that we used often during our school life and made it possible to use it as a chatbot for the convenience of users.
>
> Currently, it is only implemented for Gachon University students, but we will develop it into an application that helps many college students across the country by supplementing functions and upgrading algorithms.
